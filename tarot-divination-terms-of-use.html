    </ul>
    <p>This description is not exhaustive. We reserve the right to add, modify, or remove features from the App at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p>The App is intended as a tool for inspiration and reflection, not as a source of professional guidance.</p>

    <h2>3. For Entertainment Purposes Only</h2>
    <p>All content provided by the App, including but not limited to tarot readings, AI-generated outputs, and related texts, is for entertainment, spiritual, and personal reflection purposes only. The App and its content do not constitute, and must not be used as a substitute for, professional advice, including but not limited to medical, legal, financial, or psychological advice.</p>
    <p>You acknowledge and agree that you will not rely on the App for making significant life, financial, health, or other decisions. If you require professional assistance, you must consult a qualified and licensed specialist. You confirm that you are not using the App to diagnose, treat, or manage any medical or mental health condition, and you acknowledge that the App's content is not a substitute for professional care.</p>

    <h2>4. Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and older.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users Between 13 and 17: If you are between the ages of 13 and 17, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf. Your guardian is responsible for your use of the App, including any in-app purchases.</li>
            <li>Users Under 13: You may not use the App.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Parents and guardians are fully responsible for any charges incurred through their payment methods. We are not liable if a minor uses a credit card, debit card, or other payment instrument to make in-app purchases. We recommend enabling device-level parental controls or family payment settings to prevent unauthorized transactions.</p>

    <h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>To request deletion of your account and associated data, please send an email to <a href="mailto:runecraftingwork@gmail.com">runecraftingwork@gmail.com</a>. Include the email address from the "Account" screen and the name of the App ("Tarot Divination") in your request. You can also delete your account through the app on the account screen.</p>

    <h2>6. AI-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>Interpretations generated through the AI Interpretations and Quick AI Readings may be unpredictable, imprecise, or repetitive (due to the nature of AI). You understand and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The AI content is generated automatically based on your input</li>
        <li>The responses are not guaranteed to be accurate, complete, or useful</li>
        <li>You are responsible for evaluating the content and making your own decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By using this feature, you also agree not to use it for any unlawful or harmful purpose. We do not endorse, nor are we responsible or liable for, any content generated by the AI Interpretations and Quick AI Readings features. You use these features at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>7. Purchases and Payments</h2>
    <p>Some features of the App, including but not limited to the removal of advertisements and the purchase of virtual coins, may require payment. All payments and transactions, whether for subscriptions or one-time purchases, are processed through and are subject to the policies of the app marketplace from which you downloaded the App (e.g., the Google Play).</p>
    
    <h3>7.1 Virtual Goods and License</h3>
    <p>You acknowledge that all virtual coins and other virtual items are not real currency or property. When you purchase virtual coins or other virtual items, you are purchasing a limited, non-transferable, revocable license to use those items within the App. You do not own the virtual items themselves, and they have no cash value. They cannot be redeemed for real money, goods, or services from us or any third party.</p>
    
    <h3>7.2 One-Time Purchases</h3>
    <p>Non-Consumable Items: Purchases such as "Lifetime access without AI Features" are non-consumable and provide you with a license to use the feature for the lifetime of the App on your account.</p>
    <p>Consumable Items: Purchases such as virtual coins (e.g., AI coins) are consumable and are depleted upon use.</p>
    
    <h3>7.3 Refunds</h3>
    <p>All sales of virtual items and subscriptions are final. We will not provide refunds, except as required by applicable law or the governing refund policies of the app marketplace.</p>
    
    <h3>7.4 Subscriptions</h3>
    <p>If you purchase a subscription, it will renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Charges may occur up to 24 hours before renewal.</p>
    
    <h3>7.5 Managing Purchases</h3>
    <p>You can manage or cancel all purchases, including subscriptions, through your account settings within the relevant app marketplace. Deleting the App does not automatically cancel an active subscription or entitle you to a refund for any purchases.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Use and Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you choose to contact us. We may collect limited, anonymized data such as:</p>

        <li>App version and basic usage statistics</li>
        <li>IP address (anonymized) for regional statistics only</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data helps us improve the app experience. Some anonymized data may be shared with third-party services such as Google Analytics and Firebase for analytics, crash reporting, and performance monitoring.</p>

    <h2>11. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content and materials within the App—including text, images, graphics, and code—are the intellectual property of Yevhen Kniaziuk or used under proper license. These materials are protected by applicable copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.</p>
    <p>AI-generated content provided by the AI Interpretations and Quick AI Readings feature is powered by OpenAI and remains subject to OpenAI’s intellectual property terms. We do not claim ownership over the content generated by the AI.</p>
    <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, display, or reuse any part of the App without prior written permission. Use of the App grants you no rights to the underlying content except for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes and Service Interruptions</h2>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Yevhen Kniaziuk from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the App; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms; or (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right.</p>

IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE APP EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100 USD) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US, IF ANY, IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Ukraine. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Ukraine. If local consumer protection laws in your country provide additional rights, those rights remain unaffected.</p>
