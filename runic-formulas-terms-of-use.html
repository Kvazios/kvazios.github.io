    <p>Effective date: 18 October 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>Thank you for choosing Runic Formulas, developed by Yevhen Kniaziuk (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By accessing or using the Runic Formulas mobile application (the “App”), you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use (the “Terms”). If you do not agree with these Terms, you must stop using the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of the Service</h2>
    <p>Runic Formulas offers users a variety of tools for exploring, learning, and practicing traditional runic symbolism and Norse cultural heritage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the meanings of Elder Futhark runes</li>
        <li>Study Norse mythology and gods</li>
        <li>Read the Hávamál and other traditional texts</li>
        <li>View examples of runic formulas and Icelandic sigils</li>
        <li>Create your own bindrunes and runic formulas</li>
        <li>Discover your Birth Rune and personal formula</li>
        <li>Read introductions to runic practice, symbolism, and traditional magical uses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These materials are provided for <strong>educational, cultural, and entertainment purposes only</strong>. The App explores historical and modern interpretations of runes and magical formulas as part of cultural study. We do not claim that any formula, ritual, or practice produces real-world effects.</p>
    <p>We may add, modify, or remove features at our discretion. The App is intended for personal reflection and learning.</p>

    <h2>3. For Educational and Entertainment Purposes Only</h2>
    <p>All content in the App—including any runic formulas, instructions, or symbolic rituals—is presented solely for educational, cultural, and entertainment purposes. It does not constitute professional, spiritual, or medical advice, and should not be interpreted as a promise of outcome or result.</p>
    <p>Any information about “magic,” “energy,” or “protection” is symbolic and based on historical or folkloric traditions. You acknowledge that you use the App with this understanding and that we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, effectiveness, or success of any described practices or symbols.</p>

    <h2>4. Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for users aged 13 and older.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Users between 13 and 17:</strong> You confirm that your parent or guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf. They are responsible for your use of the App and any payments made.</li>
        <li><strong>Users under 13:</strong> You may not use the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>Runic Formulas offers paid subscriptions that unlock additional features. All payments and transactions are handled by the app marketplace from which you downloaded the App (for example, Google Play or the App Store) and are subject to that platform’s payment policies.</p>

    <h3>5.1 Automatic Renewal</h3>
    <p>Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Charges may occur up to 24 hours before renewal.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Managing Subscriptions</h3>
    <p>You can manage or cancel your subscription through your account settings in the respective app marketplace. Deleting the App does not cancel your subscription and does not entitle you to a refund.</p>

    <h3>5.3 Refunds</h3>
    <p>All sales are final. Refunds are provided only as required by law or under the refund policies of the relevant app marketplace.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Use and Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information unless you contact us directly. We may collect limited anonymous data such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type, operating system, and language</li>
        <li>App version and usage statistics</li>
        <li>Anonymized IP address for regional analytics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used to improve performance and reliability. Some data may be shared with third-party services like Google Analytics or Firebase for analytics and crash reporting.</p>
    <p>For details, please see our <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kvazios/policies/main/policy_rformulas.md">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. App Store and Device Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms are between you and Yevhen Kniaziuk only, not with the app marketplace provider. The marketplace provider (such as Google or Apple) is not responsible for the App’s performance or support. You are responsible for using a compatible device and covering any data or network costs.</p>

    <h2>8. Responsibility for Use</h2>
    <p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your use of the App and for any results of that use. You agree to hold us harmless from all liability arising from your actions, shared content, or any breach of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All text, graphics, and materials within the App are the intellectual property of Yevhen Kniaziuk or used under appropriate licenses. You may not copy, distribute, modify, or reuse any part of the App except for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes and Interruptions</h2>
    <p>We may update or modify the App and these Terms at any time. Continued use after updates means you accept the latest version. Temporary interruptions may occur for maintenance or technical reasons.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend and hold harmless Yevhen Kniaziuk from any claims, damages, or losses arising from your use of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YEVHEN KNIAZIUK AND HIS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR USE, ARISING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE APP. IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100 USD) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Ukraine. Any disputes will be handled by the courts of Ukraine. If your country’s consumer protection laws provide additional rights, those rights remain unaffected.</p>

    <p>For any questions about these Terms, contact us at <a href="mailto:runecraftingwork@gmail.com">runecraftingwork@gmail.com</a>.</p>
