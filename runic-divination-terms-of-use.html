    <h2>7. Purchases and Payments</h2>
    <p>Some features of the App, including but not limited to the removal of advertisements and the purchase of virtual coins, may require payment. All payments and transactions, whether for subscriptions or one-time purchases, are processed through and are subject to the policies of Google Play.</p>

    <p>If you purchase a subscription, it will renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Charges may occur up to 24 hours before renewal.</p>
    
    <h3>7.5 Managing Purchases</h3>
    <p>You can manage or cancel all purchases, including subscriptions, through your account settings in Google Play. Deleting the App does not automatically cancel an active subscription or entitle you to a refund for any purchases.</p>
